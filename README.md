# SQL_challenge
Homework for Module 10 of Data Analytics using SQLAlchemy for Anna Barbera

The SQL schemata were made using pgAdmin4.

In order to access the bonus notebook properly, it will be essential to create a view using view_schema_for_jupyter_notebook in pgAdmin4 as the notebook accesses it directly instead of the tables.  

Also in the bonus notebook, you will need to fill in your own username information and, when prompted by getpass in the second cell of the notebook, your own password. 

Thank you.
